If you have MATLAB, this might be worth considering (I haven't tried it myself but it has a lot more functionality than just reading MATLAB files). However, I don't know if it is allowed to distribute it to other users (it is probably not a problem if those persons have MATLAB. Otherwise, maybe NumPy is the right way to go?).</p>

<p>Also, if you want to do all the basics yourself, <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/pdf_doc/matlab/matfile_format.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MathWorks provides</a> (if the link changes, try to google for <code>matfile_format.pdf</code> or its title <code>MAT-FILE Format</code>) a detailed documentation on the structure of the file format. It's not as complicated as I personally thought, but obviously, this is not the easiest way to go. It also depends on how many features of the <code>.mat</code>-files you want to support.</p>

<p>I've written a ""small"" (about 700 lines) Python script which can read some basic <code>.mat</code>-files. I'm neither a Python expert nor a beginner and it took me about two days to write it (using the MathWorks documentation linked above). I've learned a lot of new stuff and it was quite fun (most of the time). As I've written the Python script at work, I'm afraid I cannot publish it... But I can give some advice here:</p>

<ul>
<li>First read the documentation.</li>
<li>Use a hex editor (such as <a href=""http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HxD</a>) and look into a reference <code>.mat</code>-file you want to parse.</li>
<li>Try to figure out the meaning of each byte by saving the bytes to a .txt file and annotate each line.</li>
<li>Use classes to save each data element (such as <code>miCOMPRESSED</code>, <code>miMATRIX</code>, <code>mxDOUBLE</code>, or <code>miINT32</code>)</li>
<li>The <code>.mat</code>-files' structure is optimal for saving the data elements in a tree data structure; each node has one class and subnodes</li>

<pre><code>pip install mat4py
</code></pre>

<p>It is straightforward to use (from the website):</p>

<p><strong>Load data from a MAT-file</strong></p>

<p>The function <code>loadmat</code> loads all variables stored in the MAT-file into a simple Python data structure, using only Python’s <code>dict</code> and <code>list</code> objects. Numeric and cell arrays are converted to row-ordered nested lists. Arrays are squeezed to eliminate arrays with only one element. The resulting data structure is composed of simple types that are compatible with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON"" rel=""noreferrer"">JSON</a> format.</p>

<p>Example: Load a MAT-file into a Python data structure:</p>

<pre><code>from mat4py import loadmat

data = loadmat('datafile.mat')
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <code>data</code> is a <code>dict</code> with the variables and values contained in the MAT-file.</p>

<p><strong>Save a Python data structure to a MAT-file</strong></p>

<p>Python data can be saved to a MAT-file, with the function <code>savemat</code>. Data has to be structured in the same way as for <code>loadmat</code>, i.e. it should be composed of simple data types, like <code>dict</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>int</code>, and <code>float</code>.</p>

<p>Example: Save a Python data structure to a MAT-file:</p>

<pre><code>from mat4py import savemat

savemat('datafile.mat', data)
</code></pre>

<p>The parameter <code>data</code> shall be a <code>dict</code> with the variables.</p>

<p>For the ""correct"" way see the order keyword argument of <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.sort.html#numpy.ndarray.sort"" rel=""noreferrer"">numpy.ndarray.sort</a> </p>

<p>However, you'll need to view your array as an array with fields (a structured array).</p>

<p>The ""correct"" way is quite ugly if you didn't initially define your array with fields...</p>

<p>As a quick example, to sort it and return a copy:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[0,0,1]])

In [3]: np.sort(a.view('i8,i8,i8'), order=['f1'], axis=0).view(np.int)
Out[3]: 
array([[0, 0, 1],
       [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6]])
</code></pre>

<p>To sort it in-place:</p>

<pre><code>In [6]: a.view('i8,i8,i8').sort(order=['f1'], axis=0) #&lt;-- returns None

In [7]: a
Out[7]: 
array([[0, 0, 1],
       [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6]])
</code></pre>

<p>@Steve's really is the most elegant way to do it, as far as I know... </p>

<p>The only advantage to this method is that the ""order"" argument is a list of the fields to order the search by. For example, you can sort by the second column, then the third column, then the first column by supplying order=['f1','f2','f0'].</p>

<pre><code>from numpy import *
</code></pre>

<p>so that the whole numpy namespace is included into scipy when the scipy module is imported.</p>

<p>The <code>log10</code> behavior you are describing is interesting, because <em>both</em> versions are coming from numpy. One is a <code>ufunc</code>, the other is a <code>numpy.lib</code> function. Why scipy is preferring the library function over the <code>ufunc</code>, I don't know off the top of my head.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: In fact, I can answer the <code>log10</code> question. Looking in the scipy <code>__init__</code> method I see this:</p>

<pre><code># Import numpy symbols to scipy name space
import numpy as _num
from numpy import oldnumeric
from numpy import *
from numpy.random import rand, randn
from numpy.fft import fft, ifft
from numpy.lib.scimath import *
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>log10</code> function you get in scipy comes from <code>numpy.lib.scimath</code>. Looking at that code, it says:</p>

<pre><code>""""""
Wrapper functions to more user-friendly calling of certain math functions
whose output data-type is different than the input data-type in certain
domains of the input.

For example, for functions like log() with branch cuts, the versions in this
module provide the mathematically valid answers in the complex plane:

&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; from numpy.lib import scimath
&gt;&gt;&gt; scimath.log(-math.exp(1)) == (1+1j*math.pi)
True

Similarly, sqrt(), other base logarithms, power() and trig functions are
correctly handled.  See their respective docstrings for specific examples.
""""""
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that module overlays the base numpy ufuncs for <code>sqrt</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>log2</code>, <code>logn</code>, <code>log10</code>, <code>power</code>, <code>arccos</code>, <code>arcsin</code>, and <code>arctanh</code>. That explains the behavior you are seeing. The underlying design reason why it is done like that is probably buried in a mailing list post somewhere.</p>

<p>I think this will allow someone with enough knowledge of all the packages involved to pick apart exactly what the differences are between <em>some</em> scipy and numpy functions (it didn't help me with the log10 question at all). I definitely don't have that knowledge but <code>source</code> does indicate that <code>scipy.linalg.solve</code> and <code>numpy.linalg.solve</code> interact with lapack in different ways;</p>

only be in SciPy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>What is the difference between NumPy and SciPy?</h2>
  
  <p>In an ideal world, NumPy would contain nothing but the array data type and
  the most  basic operations: indexing, sorting, reshaping, basic
  elementwise functions, et cetera. All numerical code would reside in
  SciPy. However, one of NumPy’s important goals is compatibility, so NumPy
  tries to retain all features supported by either of its predecessors. Thus
  NumPy contains some linear algebra functions, even though these more
  properly belong in SciPy. In any case, SciPy contains more fully-featured
  versions of the linear algebra modules, as well as many other numerical
  algorithms. If you are doing scientific computing with python, you should
  probably install both NumPy and SciPy. Most new features belong in SciPy
  rather than NumPy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That explains why <code>scipy.linalg.solve</code> offers some additional features over <code>numpy.linalg.solve</code>.</p>

<p>But it's slow.</p>

<p>Fortunately, numpy includes a <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.convolve.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">convolve</a> function which we can use to speed things up. The running mean is equivalent to convolving <code>x</code> with a vector that is <code>N</code> long, with all members equal to <code>1/N</code>. The numpy implementation of convolve includes the starting transient, so you have to remove the first N-1 points:</p>

<pre><code>def runningMeanFast(x, N):
    return np.convolve(x, np.ones((N,))/N)[(N-1):]
</code></pre>

<p>On my machine, the fast version is 20-30 times faster, depending on the length of the input vector and size of the averaging window.</p>

<p>Note that convolve does include a <code>'same'</code> mode which seems like it should address the starting transient issue,  but it splits it between the beginning and end.</p>

<p>You can use <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.convolve.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>np.convolve</code></a> for that:</p>
<pre><code>np.convolve(x, np.ones(N)/N, mode='valid')
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>The running mean is a case of the mathematical operation of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">convolution</a>. For the running mean, you slide a window along the input and compute the mean of the window's contents. For discrete 1D signals, convolution is the same thing, except instead of the mean you compute an arbitrary linear combination, i.e., multiply each element by a corresponding coefficient and add up the results. Those coefficients, one for each position in the window, are sometimes called the convolution <em>kernel</em>. The arithmetic mean of N values is <code>(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_N) / N</code>, so the corresponding kernel is <code>(1/N, 1/N, ..., 1/N)</code>, and that's exactly what we get by using <code>np.ones(N)/N</code>.</p>
<h3>Edges</h3>
<p>The <code>mode</code> argument of <code>np.convolve</code> specifies how to handle the edges. I chose the <code>valid</code> mode here because I think that's how most people expect the running mean to work, but you may have other priorities. Here is a plot that illustrates the difference between the modes:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
modes = ['full', 'same', 'valid']
for m in modes:
    plt.plot(np.convolve(np.ones(200), np.ones(50)/50, mode=m));
plt.axis([-10, 251, -.1, 1.1]);
plt.legend(modes, loc='lower center');
plt.show()

<p>Convolution is much better than straightforward approach, but (I guess) it uses FFT and thus quite slow. However specially for computing the running mean the following approach works fine</p>

<pre><code>def running_mean(x, N):
    cumsum = numpy.cumsum(numpy.insert(x, 0, 0)) 
    return (cumsum[N:] - cumsum[:-N]) / float(N)
</code></pre>

<p>The code to check</p>

<pre><code>In[3]: x = numpy.random.random(100000)
In[4]: N = 1000
In[5]: %timeit result1 = numpy.convolve(x, numpy.ones((N,))/N, mode='valid')
10 loops, best of 3: 41.4 ms per loop
In[6]: %timeit result2 = running_mean(x, N)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.04 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>numpy.allclose(result1, result2)</code> is <code>True</code>, two methods are equivalent.
The greater N, the greater difference in time.</p>

<h3>warning: although cumsum is faster there will be increased floating point error that may cause your results to be invalid/incorrect/unacceptable</h3>

<li>the more points you accumulate over the greater the floating point error (so 1e5 points is noticable, 1e6 points is more significant, more than 1e6 and you may want to resetting the accumulators)</li>
<li>you can cheat by using <a href=""https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.types.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>np.longdouble</code></a> but your floating point error still will get significant for relatively large number of points (around >1e5 but depends on your data)</li>

It is linear in the number of elements of the input list and I cannot think of any other way to make it more efficient (actually if anyone knows of a better way to allocate the result, please let me know).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this would be much faster using a numpy array instead of a list, but I wanted to eliminate all dependencies. It would also be possible to improve performance by multi-threaded execution</p>

<p>The function assumes that the input list is one dimensional, so be careful.</p>

<pre><code>### Running mean/Moving average
def running_mean(l, N):

    for i in range( N, len(l) ):
        sum = sum - l[i-N] + l[i]
        result[i] = sum / N

    return result
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Assume that we have a list <code>data = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]</code> on which we want to compute a rolling mean with period of 3, and that you also want a output list that is the same size of the input one (that's most often the case).</p>

<p>The first element has index 0, so the rolling mean should be computed on elements of index -2, -1 and 0. Obviously we don't have data[-2] and data[-1] (unless you want to use special boundary conditions), so we assume that those elements are 0. This is equivalent to zero-padding the list, except we don't actually pad it, just keep track of the indices that require padding (from 0 to N-1).</p>

<p>So, for the first N elements we just keep adding up the elements in an accumulator.</p>

<pre><code>result[0] = (0 + 0 + 1) / 3  = 0.333    ==   (sum + 1) / 3
result[1] = (0 + 1 + 2) / 3  = 1        ==   (sum + 2) / 3
result[2] = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3  = 2        ==   (sum + 3) / 3
</code></pre>

<p>From elements N+1 forwards simple accumulation doesn't work. we expect <code>result[3] = (2 + 3 + 4)/3 = 3</code> but this is different from <code>(sum + 4)/3 = 3.333</code>.</p>

<p>The way to compute the correct value is to subtract <code>data[0] = 1</code> from <code>sum+4</code>, thus giving  <code>sum + 4 - 1 = 9</code>. </p>

<p>This happens because currently <code>sum = data[0] + data[1] + data[2]</code>, but it is also true for every <code>i &gt;= N</code> because, before the subtraction, <code>sum</code> is <code>data[i-N] + ... + data[i-2] + data[i-1]</code>.</p>

<p>See basic sample below:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import bottleneck as bn

a = np.random.randint(4, 1000, size=100)
mm = bn.move_mean(a, window=5, min_count=1)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>""mm"" is the moving mean for ""a"". </p></li>
<li><p>""window"" is the max number of entries to consider for moving mean. </p></li>
<li><p>""min_count"" is min number of entries to consider for moving mean (e.g. for first few elements or if the array has nan values).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The good part is Bottleneck helps to deal with nan values and it's also very efficient.</p>

It uses least squares to regress a small window of your data onto a polynomial, then uses the polynomial to estimate the point in the center of the window. Finally the window is shifted forward by one data point and the process repeats. This continues until every point has been optimally adjusted relative to its neighbors. It works great even with noisy samples from non-periodic and non-linear sources.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook/SavitzkyGolay"" rel=""noreferrer"">thorough cookbook example</a>. See my code below to get an idea of how easy it is to use.

</code></pre>
<p>Kernel regression scales badly, Lowess is a bit faster, but both produce smooth curves. Savgol is a middle ground on speed and can produce both jumpy and smooth outputs, depending on the grade of the polynomial. FFT is extremely fast, but only works on periodic data.</p>
<p>Moving average methods with numpy are faster but obviously produce a graph with steps in it.</p>
<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>I generated 1000 data points in the shape of a sin curve:</p>
<pre><code>size = 1000
x = np.linspace(0, 4 * np.pi, size)
y = np.sin(x) + np.random.random(size) * 0.2
data = {&quot;x&quot;: x, &quot;y&quot;: y}
</code></pre>
<p>I pass these into a function to measure the runtime and plot the resulting fit:</p>
<pre><code>def test_func(f, label):  # f: function handle to one of the smoothing methods
    start = time()
    for i in range(5):
        arr = f(data[&quot;y&quot;], 20)
    print(f&quot;{label:26s} - time: {time() - start:8.5f} &quot;)
    plt.plot(data[&quot;x&quot;], arr, &quot;-&quot;, label=label)
</code></pre>
<p>I tested many different smoothing fuctions. <code>arr</code> is the array of y values to be smoothed and <code>span</code> the smoothing parameter. The lower, the better the fit will approach the original data, the higher, the smoother the resulting curve will be.</p>

<p>Especially <code>kernel regression</code> is very slow to compute over 1k elements, <code>lowess</code> also fails when the dataset becomes much larger. <code>numpy convolve</code> and <code>fft</code> are especially fast. I did not investigate the runtime behavior (O(n)) with increasing or decreasing sample size.</p>
<h2>Edge behavior</h2>
<p>I'll separate this part into two, to keep image understandable.</p>
<p>Numpy based methods + <code>savgol 0</code>:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BapVF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BapVF.png"" alt=""Edge behaviour of numpy based methods"" /></a></p>
<p>These methods calculate an average of the data, the graph is not smoothed. They all (with the exception of <code>numpy.cumsum</code>) result in the same graph when the window that is used to calculate the average does not touch the edge of the data. The discrepancy to <code>numpy.cumsum</code> is most likely due to a 'off by one' error in the window size.</p>
<p>There are different edge behaviours when the method has to work with less data:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>savgol 0</code>: continues with a constant to the edge of the data (<code>savgol 1</code> and <code>savgol 2</code> end with a line and parabola respectively)</li>
<li><code>numpy average</code>: stops when the window reaches the left side of the data and fills those places in the array with <code>Nan</code>, same behaviour as <code>my_average</code> method on the right side</li>
<li><code>numpy convolve</code>: follows the data pretty accurately. I suspect the window size is reduced symmetrically when one side of the window reaches the edge of the data</li>
<li><code>my_average</code>/<code>me</code>: my own method that I implemented, because I was not satisfied with the other ones. Simply shrinks the part of the window that is reaching beyond the data to the edge of the data, but keeps the window to the other side the original size given with <code>span</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Complicated methods:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNrKb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNrKb.png"" alt=""Edge behaviour of the complicated methods"" /></a></p>
<p>These methods all end with a nice fit to the data. <code>savgol 1</code> ends with a line, <code>savgol 2</code> with a parabola.</p>
<h2>Curve behaviour</h2>
<p>To showcase the behaviour of the different methods in the middle of the data.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXjeC.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXjeC.png"" alt=""Curve behavior of the different methods"" /></a></p>
<p>The different <code>savgol</code> and <code>average</code> filters produce a rough line, <code>lowess</code>, <code>fft</code> and <code>kernel regression</code> produce a smooth fit. <code>lowess</code> appears to cut corners when the data changes.</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>I have a Raspberry Pi logging data for fun and the visualization proved to be a small challenge. All data points, except RAM usage and ethernet traffic are only recorded in discrete steps and/or inherently noisy. For example the temperature sensor only outputs whole degrees, but differs by up to two degrees between consecutive measurements. No useful information can be gained from such a scatter plot. To visualize the data I therefore needed some method that is not too computationally expensive and produced a moving average. I also wanted nice behavior at the edges of the data, as this especially impacts the latest info when looking at live data. I settled on the <code>numpy convolve</code> method with <code>my_average</code> to improve the edge behavior.</p>

<li><p>Conda replaces virtualenv. In my opinion it is better. It is not limited to Python but can be used for other languages too. In my experience it provides a much smoother experience, especially for scientific packages. The first time I got MayaVi properly installed on Mac was with <code>conda</code>.   </p></li>
<li><p>You can still use <code>pip</code>. In fact, <code>conda</code> installs <code>pip</code> in each new environment. It knows about pip-installed packages.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>conda list
</code></pre>

<p>lists all installed packages in your current environment.
Conda-installed packages show up like this:</p>

<pre><code>sphinx_rtd_theme          0.1.7                    py35_0    defaults
</code></pre>

<p>and the ones installed via <code>pip</code> have the <code>&lt;pip&gt;</code> marker:</p>

<pre><code>wxpython-common           3.0.0.0                   &lt;pip&gt;

<pre><code>&gt; conda create --name &lt;envname&gt; python=&lt;version&gt; &lt;optional dependencies&gt;

&gt; conda remove --name &lt;envname&gt; --all 
</code></pre>

<p>In an <a href=""https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment"" rel=""noreferrer"">activated environment</a>, install packages via <code>conda</code> or <code>pip</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(envname)&gt; conda install &lt;package&gt;

(envname)&gt; pip install &lt;package&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These environments are strongly tied to <a href=""http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/pkgs.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">conda's pip-like package management</a>, so it is simple to create environments and install both Python and non-Python packages.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Jupyter</strong></p>

<p>In addition, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39604271/conda-environments-not-showing-up-in-jupyter-notebook"">installing <code>ipykernel</code></a> in an environment adds a new listing in the Kernels dropdown menu of Jupyter notebooks, extending reproducible environments to notebooks.  As of Anaconda 4.1, <a href=""https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/changelog"" rel=""noreferrer"">nbextensions were added</a>, adding extensions to notebooks more easily.</p>

<p><strong>Reliability</strong></p>

<p>In my experience, conda is faster and more reliable at installing large libraries such as <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code>.  Moreover, if you wish to transfer your the preserved state of an environment, you can do so by <a href=""https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment"" rel=""noreferrer"">sharing</a> or <a href=""https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#cloning-an-environment"" rel=""noreferrer"">cloning</a> an env.</p>

"48982620","2","","34398676","2018-02-26 06:27:34","","18","","<p>Installing Conda will enable you to create and remove python environments as you wish, therefore providing you with same functionality as <a href=""https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/"" rel=""noreferrer"">virtualenv</a> would.</p>

<p>In case of both distributions you would be able to create an isolated filesystem tree, where you can install and remove python packages (probably, with pip) as you wish. Which might come in handy if you want to have different versions of same library for different use cases or you just want to try some distribution and remove it afterwards conserving your disk space.</p>

<h3>Differences:</h3>

<p>License agreement. While virtualenv comes under most liberal <a href=""https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"" rel=""noreferrer"">MIT license</a>, <a href=""https://conda.io/docs/license.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Conda</a> uses 3 clause BSD license.</p>

<p>Conda provides you with their own package control system. This package control system often provides precompiled versions (for most popular systems) of popular non-python software, which can easy ones way getting some machine learning packages working. Namely you don't have to compile optimized C/C++ code for you system. While it is a great relief for most of us, it might affect performance of such libraries.</p>

<p>Unlike virtualenv, Conda duplicating some system libraries at least on Linux system. This libraries can get out of sync leading to inconsistent behavior of your programs.</p>

<h3>Verdict:</h3>

<p>Conda is great and should be your default choice while starting your way with machine learning. It will save you some time messing with gcc and numerous packages. Yet, Conda does not replace virtualenv. It introduces some additional complexity which might not always be desired. It comes under different license. You might want to avoid using conda on a distributed environments or on HPC hardware. </p>

By <em>default</em> Conda prefers to manage a list of environments for you in a central location, whereas virtualenv makes a folder in the current directory.  The former (centralized) makes sense if you are e.g. doing machine learning and just have a couple of broad environments that you use across many projects and want to jump into them from anywhere.  The latter (per project folder) makes sense if you are doing little one-off projects that have completely different sets of lib requirements that really belong more to the project itself.</p>

<p>The empty environment that Conda creates is about 122MB whereas the virtualenv's is about 12MB, so that's another reason you may prefer not to scatter Conda environments around everywhere.</p>

<p>Finally, another superficial indication that Conda prefers its centralized envs is that (again, by default) if you do create a Conda env in your own project folder and activate it the name prefix that appears in your shell is the (way too long) absolute path to the folder.  You can fix that by giving it a name, but virtualenv does the right thing by default.</p>

<p>I expect this info to become stale rapidly as the two package managers vie for dominance, but these are the trade-offs as of today :)</p>
